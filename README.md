# Email-Fraud-Detection-
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent or phishing emails using machine learning techniques.   The goal is to build a model that can classify emails as **legitimate** or **fraudulent**, helping users and organizations protect themselves from scams, phishing attempts, and malicious content.

# Features
- Preprocessing of raw email text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF / word embeddings.
- Machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes).
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Easy-to-use script for training and testing.

# Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk  
- **Dataset**: Public email datasets (e.g., Enron dataset, SpamAssassin corpus)
